# Stella's CS 61A Projects
This repository contains the projects I did in UC Berkeley's CS61a course, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" in Spring 2018.

It comes included with the files required for functionality, but also the files the course instructors and professor used to check and grade our work. Maybe in the future I will prune these files so that it only contains the necessary bits. 

Note: Not all code was written by me. Skeleton code was provided by the professor and instructors. My own code can be found between "BEGIN PORBLEM XX" and "END PROBLEM XX" labels in the code.

## Ants
To run ants, run `python3 ants.gui` in terminal or open the html file.

## Scheme
This version of the scheme interpreter runs in the terminal. It was written in python. Run `python3 scheme.py` to run the scheme interpreter in terminal.

## Scheme Art Contest
My entry for the Spring 2018 scheme art contest. I created a 2D image using turtle graphics and the scheme interpreter that we built in this class as part of a previous project (see above). Here is the final version!
